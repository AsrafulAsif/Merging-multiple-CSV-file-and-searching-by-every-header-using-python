# Merging-multiple-CSV-file-and-searching-by-every-header-using-python
A program in Python 3 (.py)  to merge the attached COVID-19 weekly data files and implement search by Date, Daily new confirmed cases, Total confirmed cases, Daily new deaths, Total deaths, Daily new recovered, Total recovered, Daily New Tests, Total Tests, Active Cases etc. 
Here is 13 files but have some duplicate data. This merging.py code has the power to remove the duplicates data.
If some one do same type of project ,first you need to change all the files name. I do change file name like file1,file2,file3 etc.Because we use a loop to merging all file.
I don't use pandas module here.
